Temperature control on a DE1 board. Functionality to increase/decrease temperature between 10 degrees and 35 degrees. A voltage is written and read from  d/a & and a/d pins to mimic an actual sensor. Temperature is outputted to 7 segment displays, LCD and the PC screen. This project was worked on by me and my partner (Ken Manalo) @ Seneca College for MCO455.
